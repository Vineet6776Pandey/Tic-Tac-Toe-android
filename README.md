# Remaining large files (greater than 100mb)

Some files were  larger than 100 MB, so I couldn't upload them to GitHub. Instead, I've uploaded them to Google Drive.  Google Drive also contain their respective file locations for your reference in the google docs file in drive. 

You can access them using the link below:
